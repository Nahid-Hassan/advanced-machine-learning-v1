    "You've likely seen this before. A successful ML engineer will need to decompose a machine learning solution into the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identify the type of `Model` for the problem.\n",
    "2. `Design` the model.\n",
    "3. `Prepare` the `Data` for the model.\n",
    "4. `Train` the model.\n",
    "5. `Deploy` the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is very `2017`. It’s now `2020` and a lot of things have progressed. There are now vasts numbers of model types, but with abstractions -- like composable -- we are seeing model types converging and likely by 2022 we will see just a handful of `abstractions covering all types of production.`\n",
    "\n",
    "Outside of research, ML practitioners `don’t design models`, they `guide` the design of the models. `Data preparation` is becoming more `automated`, some of which is moving into the models and other\n",
    "cases handled upstream by other models that have learned to prepare data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We don’t train one model anymore, we train a `plurality` of models, and for each model we train instances of the model in stages from warmup, pre-training and finally full-training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Models are deployed in a wide variety of manners from the cloud, to mobile devices, to IoT (edge) devices. The deployment may modify the model (e.g., `quantization, compression`), perform continuous evaluation and be updated and versioned with continuous integration/continuous development (`CI/CD`).\n",
    "\n",
    "And the above list does not cover other new things we see in production, such as `QA`, `A/B testing`, `auditing` and `bias adjustments`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Everyone is specializing, and likely you will too, pick a speciality that fits your skills and passion.\n",
    "Welcome to AI in 2020."
